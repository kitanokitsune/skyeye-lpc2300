known issue:
---------------------
gdb remote debug is not stable
type very slow in several testcases 

short term:
----------
- improve the auto test framework to test network , lcd, flash etc.
- mips simulation
- x86 simulation
- ppc simulation

long term:
------------
- mutilple thread implementation in simualtion
- a common dynamic translation framework for arm and blackfin

lower priority:
--------------
- skyeye.conf in XML format 
- GUI config program for skyeye.conf
- improve speed of skyeye simulation
- performace test of skyeye simulation, maybe nbench-byte?
