Compile & Install the driver
============================
 - Run the command "make install" within this directory to compile and install the driver.
 - Restart the network, then you'll get "/dev/net/skyeye_tap/0" on your system.


Special on BeOS R5.0.x
======================
 - You should get an addon for net_server, see below.
 - On BeOS R5.0.x, there are no "ifconfig", so you must manually set the IP address
   and net mask to be the correct value, for example: 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.0


How to compile the addon for net_server on BeOS R5.0.x 
======================================================
 - First you must download "Be Sample Code" from http://www.bebits.com/app/3019.
 - Then replace the lines like below in "sample-code/drivers/EtherPCI/Addon/ne2000pci.cpp"
		static const char TITLE[] = "Novell NE2000 compatible adapter (PCI) Sample";
		static const char CONFIG[] = "ne2000pci";
		static const char LINK[] = "/dev/net/etherpci";
   with
		static const char TITLE[] = "SkyEye TAP Driver";
		static const char CONFIG[] = "skyeye_tap";
		static const char LINK[] = "/dev/net/skyeye_tap";
 - Third, compile the project and rename the target's name("ne2000pci") to be "skyeye_tap".
 - At last, copy or move "skyeye_tap" that you renamed to "/boot/beos/system/add-ons/net_server/skyeye_tap"
 - Restart the net server and fit the IP/mask to be correct.


How to write application like what I did with tuntap driver on Linux
====================================================================
 - Please remember that the codes isn't comed from Linux, so there are diffrent.
 - See "device/net/skyeye_net_tap_beos.c" to find out how to write it.
